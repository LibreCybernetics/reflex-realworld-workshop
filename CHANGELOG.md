# Changelog
All changes to the workshop will be documented here with instructions for how you should update local code / vms when upgrading.

For each new version, there will also be a github release: so please watch this repo for new releases if you are keen to be notified! :)

## Version 0.1.0 - 2019-05-08
This is the first release without any content. This is the skeleton of the code and all the dependencies. If you follow the [setup instruction](./SETUP.md) to a clean ob run, then it should just be a git pull later to get the exercises and it should just work without any big rebuilds or waits.

- Released initial version
