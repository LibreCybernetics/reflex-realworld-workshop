<h1 id="bonus-exercises">Bonus Exercises</h1>
<p>If you finish early or are after different challenges. Try the following:</p>
<h2 id="implement-form-disable-while-submitting">Implement Form Disable while Submitting</h2>
<p>Mark all inputs and the submit button as disabled while the backend call is pending.</p>
<h2 id="implement-the-user-feed-tab-on-the-home-page">Implement the user feed tab on the home page</h2>
<p>If logged in, the default homepage view should be the output of /api/articles/feed. This is tricky because you have to use higher order FRP to switch in a different backend call depending on the selection.</p>
<h2 id="create-post-form">Create Post Form</h2>
<p>See if you can create the create post form from scratch.</p>
<p>For even more bonus marks, see if you can get a live preview from typing events in the markdown text area. You may need to throttle these events to get decent UX out of it.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-validation">Client Side Validation</h2>
<p>Use Data.Validation and Data.Functor.Compose together to validate as you collect form input values. Connect failed validations with onBlur events to display / hide them when things fail / are resolved.</p>
<h2 id="implement-pagination">Implement Pagination</h2>
<p>This hasn't been done in the example yet. But the article list calls take a limit and an offset and they return you a row count when they return. Can you run with this and implement pagination?</p>
<h2 id="implement-favourite--unfavourite-of-articles">Implement Favourite / UnFavourite of articles</h2>
<p>This is hard because these calls aren't implemented in the API yet! You'll have to figure out all the servant layers to make this happen.</p>
<p>It's also a revision of the behaviour that we saw in the article comments: that we are updating our local state based on the backend call.</p>
<p>Same goes for profile follow / unfollow.</p>
