This workshop is a step by step walkthrough of how to implement the [Real World Demo App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api) spec in Obelisk/Reflex. The full implementation is available in the submodule sitting in reflex-realworld-example if you want to see the finished product or peek at it for answers. :)

This is being presented at YOW Lambda Jam 2019, but I hope that this continues as a living resource and example after the conference, so if it becomes out of date with the latest Obelisk, please file an issue or PR!

## Keeping in Touch / Getting assistance

When I release new changes to the workshop, I will release them as github releases. If you are doing the workshop at Lambda Jam, I highly recommend watching this repo for releases so I can let you know to pull new code if necessary.

If you have any issues or questions with the material, please feel free to reach out via a github issue, the gitter room or #QFPL on freenode.

## Setup Instructions

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).
